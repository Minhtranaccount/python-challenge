# python-challenge

Int this project, I have created a Python script to analyse the financial records of the provided company based on a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The Python script analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# Folder 1: PyBank 

  Use dataset budget_data (with two columns date and profit/losses) to analyse the financial records of the company

  Sub Folder 1 - analysis. This folder includes a text file (.txt) - analysis result which was exported from Python script
  
  Sub Folder 2 - Resources. This folder has the csv file of budget_data
  
  Python File: main.py - this file has all Python Scripts to run the report

# Folder 2: PyPoll

  Use dataset election_data (with three columns Ballot ID, County and Candidate) to analyse the votes of each candidate and determine the winner of the election.

  Sub Folder 1 - analysis. This folder includes a text file (.txt) - analysis result which was exported from Python script
  
  Sub Folder 2 - Resources. This folder has the csv file of election_data
  
  Python File: main.py - this file has all Python Scripts to run the report
  
# README File
  Provide description of the python-challenge.
